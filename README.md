## ML Engineering course by EPAM
The course includes 6 modules that cover the skills of a machine learning engineer.  
A Machine Learning Engineer designs, builds, and productionizes ML models to solve business challenges. The ML Engineer should be proficient in all aspects of model architecture, data pipeline interaction, and metrics interpretation. The ML Engineer needs familiarity with foundational concepts of application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance. Through an understanding of training, retraining, deploying, scheduling, monitoring, and improving models, the ML Engineer designs and creates scalable solutions for optimal performance.
